            <p class="lead">
                COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a complex virus relying on various proteins for infection, replication, and survival. Understanding these proteins is key to combating the virus and developing effective treatments and vaccines.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Proteins and Their Roles</h2>
            <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Spike (S) Protein:</strong> Facilitates viral entry into human cells by binding to ACE2 receptors. Mutations in this protein, seen in variants like Delta and Omicron, influence transmission rates and immune evasion.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Nucleocapsid (N) Protein:</strong> Protects the viral RNA and interacts with the host's immune system. It is a target for diagnostic tests due to its stability.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) Proteins:</strong> Aid in viral assembly, stability, and release from infected cells.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Non-Structural Proteins (NSPs):</strong> Support viral replication and immune suppression. For example, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is crucial for copying the viral genome.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Mutations in these proteins drive the emergence of new variants, making it challenging to maintain vaccine efficacy. However, advancements in bivalent vaccines targeting multiple strains show promise in adapting to these changes.

            <h2>Impact of Variants</h2>
            <p>
                Variants like Delta and Omicron demonstrate how small changes in proteins can significantly affect transmissibility, disease severity, and immune system evasion. These mutations have led to faster-spreading strains and, in some cases, reduced vaccine effectiveness. Continued research is essential to stay ahead of these changes and protect public health.

        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Spike Protein Mutations:</strong> 
                Vaccines like mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna primarily target the spike protein. 
                New strains, such as Omicron, with significant changes in the spike protein, may partially evade antibodies produced by existing vaccines.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Increased Genetic Diversity:</strong>
                Mutations in non-structural proteins or accessory proteins can enhance replication or immune evasion, complicating vaccine design. 
                Variants may evolve under immune pressure, necessitating updated vaccines.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Shorter Immunity Duration:</strong>
                Rapidly changing strains might require booster shots to maintain immunity.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Vaccine Effectiveness:</strong>
                Vaccines need to cover multiple strains or anticipate dominant variants. 
                Example: Bivalent vaccines targeting Omicron and earlier strains have been developed to address such challenges.

                <strong>Increased Transmissibility:</strong>
                Changes in the spike protein can improve the virus's ability to infect cells, increasing the rate of spread.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Severity of Disease:</strong>
                Certain mutations may enhance viral replication or disrupt immune system signaling, leading to more severe symptoms. 
                Example: Delta variant caused more severe respiratory symptoms than earlier strains.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Immune Evasion:</strong>
                Mutations in proteins like ORF8 may reduce the ability of the immune system to detect and respond to the virus.

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Long-term Effects:</strong>
                Variants with unique protein interactions can trigger prolonged inflammatory responses or long COVID symptoms.
